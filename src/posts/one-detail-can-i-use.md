# 1 very important detail about caniuse.com

TLDR: 44% of the user global support statistics are not reliable.

Thereâ€™s a crucial detail thatâ€™s often overlooked when discussing user support
statistics for a specific feature on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com).

Can I Use canâ€™t display user usage per Chrome version for Android devices.
Thatâ€™s why it shows all Chrome for Android usage up to the latest version of
Android. You can see this in the image below.

    />

This statistic is not accurate. Many older Android devices donâ€™t support the
latest version of Chrome. Therefore, we canâ€™t trust 44% of the user support
statistics.

Letâ€™s consider an example. When we search for container queries on caniuse.com,
we notice that it claims global support of approximately 91% of users. However,
itâ€™s important to note that a significant portion of this 91%, around 44%, is
uncertain. Almost half of the devices that support container queries may not
actually support them ðŸ¤¯

Knowing this it is important to always provide fallbacks for â€˜relatively newâ€™
browser features. The web was built for progressive enhancements. Ship them and
deliver better websites.
